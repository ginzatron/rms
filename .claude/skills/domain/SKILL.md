# GME Domain Knowledge

## ACGME Framework

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) is the regulatory body for residency programs in the US.

### Core Oversight Areas

1. **Sponsoring Institution** - Holds ACGME accreditation, has a DIO (Designated Institutional Official)
2. **Programs** - Individual residency/fellowship programs (e.g., General Surgery Residency)
3. **Participating Sites** - Affiliate institutions where residents train (require PLAs - Program Letter Agreements)
4. **GMEC** - Graduate Medical Education Committee at the institutional level
5. **CCC** - Clinical Competency Committee at the program level

### Six Core Competencies

All residents must demonstrate growth in:

1. **Patient Care (PC)** - Compassionate, appropriate, effective care
2. **Medical Knowledge (MK)** - Established and evolving biomedical sciences
3. **Practice-Based Learning and Improvement (PBLI)** - Investigate and evaluate care
4. **Interpersonal and Communication Skills (ICS)** - Effective information exchange
5. **Professionalism (PROF)** - Ethical principles and professional responsibilities
6. **Systems-Based Practice (SBP)** - Awareness of healthcare system context

### Milestones

Developmental markers reported semi-annually to ACGME. Each specialty has specific milestones mapped to the 6 competencies. Levels 1-5 represent progression from novice to expert.

## EPA (Entrustable Professional Activities)

### What EPAs Are

EPAs are specific clinical activities that trainees must demonstrate competency in before practicing independently. Unlike milestones (which describe abilities), EPAs describe actual clinical work.

### Entrustment Scale (1-5)

1. **Level 1** - Observation only
2. **Level 2** - Direct supervision (supervisor present/scrubbed)
3. **Level 3** - Indirect supervision (supervisor immediately available)
4. **Level 4** - Supervision on demand (supervisor available when needed)
5. **Level 5** - Practice ready (can supervise others)

### General Surgery EPAs (ABS - American Board of Surgery)

18 EPAs organized by category:

**Preoperative (1-2):**
1. Preoperative Assessment and Informed Consent
2. Preoperative Planning

**Intraoperative (3-10):**
3. Appendectomy (laparoscopic or open)
4. Inguinal Hernia Repair
5. Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy
6. Bowel Resection
7. Soft Tissue Mass Excision
8. Central Venous Catheter Insertion
9. Trauma Laparotomy
10. Create Intestinal Stoma

**Postoperative (11-12):**
11. Postoperative Management
12. Recognition/Management of Complications

**Longitudinal (13-15):**
13. Multi-day Patient Management
14. End-of-life Care
15. Care Transitions and Handoffs

**Professional (16-18):**
16. Leading a Healthcare Team
17. Systems-Based Practice and Patient Safety
18. Practice-Based Learning and Quality Improvement

### EPA Assessment Requirements

- Minimum ~2 assessments per week per trainee
- ~50 assessments over 6 months
- Mobile capture in clinical workflow
- Real-time workplace-based assessment
- Supervisor entrustment ratings with narrative feedback

## Institutional Structure

### Institution vs Institution Role

**Key concept**: An institution is a physical entity (hospital, medical school). The institution *plays roles* in the GME system.

```
Institution (physical entity)
└── Roles it plays:
    ├── Sponsoring Role (if it runs programs)
    │   └── Has: DIO, GMEC, ACGME accreditation, site visits
    └── Participating Role (if it hosts residents from other programs)
        └── Has: PLAs with sponsoring institutions
```

### Sponsoring Role

When an institution is a sponsor:
- Holds ACGME institutional accreditation
- Has a DIO (Designated Institutional Official)
- Has a GMEC (Graduate Medical Education Committee)
- Runs residency/fellowship programs
- Undergoes ACGME site visits

### Participating Role

When an institution is a participant:
- Provides clinical training sites for another institution's programs
- Requires PLA (Program Letter Agreement) with the sponsoring institution
- Examples: VA hospitals, community hospitals, affiliate academic centers

### Why This Distinction Matters

An institution can be **BOTH** a sponsor AND a participant:

| Institution | Sponsoring Role | Participating Role |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| MGH | Sponsors MGH General Surgery | Participates in HMS programs |
| VA Boston | None | Participates in MGH programs |
| BWH | Sponsors BWH Internal Medicine | Participates in MGH programs |

This is why we model "roles" separately from "institutions" - the same hospital can simultaneously:
1. Run its own programs (sponsoring role)
2. Be an affiliate for other programs (participating role)
3. Have multiple PLAs with different sponsors

## Clinical Competency Committee (CCC)

### Purpose

- Reviews resident progress semi-annually
- Determines milestone levels
- Identifies residents needing support/remediation
- Makes promotion/graduation recommendations

### CCC Workflow

1. Aggregate data: EPAs, evaluations, procedures, professionalism
2. Pre-meeting: Generate resident summary packets
3. Meeting: Review each resident, document decisions
4. Output: Milestone determinations, action items, remediation plans
5. Report: Submit milestones to ACGME

## Resident Lifecycle

1. **Application/Match** - ERAS/NRMP process
2. **Onboarding** - Credentialing, orientation
3. **Training** - Rotations, assessments, evaluations
4. **Progression** - Annual advancement (PGY-1 → PGY-2, etc.)
5. **CCC Reviews** - Semi-annual milestone determinations
6. **Graduation** - Completion certification
7. **Fellowship** (optional) - Subspecialty training

## Subspecialties

Many specialties have subspecialty fellowships:

- **General Surgery** → Vascular Surgery (2 years), Surgical Critical Care (1 year), etc.
- **Internal Medicine** → Cardiology (3 years), Gastroenterology (3 years), etc.

Subspecialties require completion of prerequisite training (the parent specialty).

## Duty Hours

ACGME mandates:
- 80-hour weekly limit (averaged over 4 weeks)
- 1 day off in 7 (averaged over 4 weeks)
- Adequate rest between shifts
- Fatigue mitigation protocols

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| PGY | Post-Graduate Year (PGY-1 = intern) |
| DIO | Designated Institutional Official |
| GMEC | Graduate Medical Education Committee |
| CCC | Clinical Competency Committee |
| EPA | Entrustable Professional Activity |
| PLA | Program Letter Agreement |
| ADS | ACGME Accreditation Data System |
| ERAS | Electronic Residency Application Service |
| NRMP | National Resident Matching Program |
| ASA | American Society of Anesthesiologists (patient classification) |
